# [!NOTE]
# Read the `docs/configuration_guide.md` carefully, and update the
# configurations to match your specific settings and requirements.
# - Replace `api_key` with your own credentials.
# - Replace `base_url` and `model` name if you want to use a custom model.
# - Set `verify_ssl` to `false` if your LLM server uses self-signed certificates
# - A restart is required every time you change the `config.yaml` file.
